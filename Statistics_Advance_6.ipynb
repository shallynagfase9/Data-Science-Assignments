        "To use ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), several assumptions must be met for the results to be valid. The key assumptions for ANOVA are:\n",
        "Normality: Each sample should be drawn from a normally distributed population.\n",
        "Equal Variances: The variances of the populations that the samples come from should be equal.\n",
        "Independence: The observations within each group should be independent of each other, and the observations in each group should be obtained through a random sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "Violations of these assumptions can impact the validity of ANOVA results. Examples of violations include:\n",
        "Normality: If the data is not normally distributed, it can affect the accuracy of the results. Violations can be detected through visual checks like histograms or Q-Q plots, or formal statistical tests like Shapiro-Wilk or Kolmogorov-Smirnov.\n",
        "Equal Variances: Unequal variances among groups can impact the reliability of ANOVA results. While ANOVA is robust to minor violations, severe violations may require alternative tests like the Kruskal-Wallis Test.\n",
        "Independence: If observations are not independent within groups or obtained through a randomized process, the results of ANOVA can be unreliable. In such cases, setting up the experiment again with a randomized design is recommended.\n",

        "\"\"\"\n",
        "The three types of ANOVA are One-Way ANOVA, Two-Way ANOVA, and N-Way ANOVA (also known as MANOVA).\n",
        "One-Way ANOVA: This is the most commonly used method of performing the ANOVA test. It is used to compare the means of two or more independent groups using the F-distribution. It is used when there is only one independent variable with at least two levels. One-way ANOVA does not differ much from the t-test.\n",
        "Example: A teacher wants to know how good he has been in teaching with the students. So, he can split the students of the class into different groups and assign different projects related to the topics taught to them. He can use one-way ANOVA to compare the average score of each group. He can get a rough understanding of topics to teach again.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two-Way ANOVA: This is carried out when there are two independent variables. Two-way ANOVA allows for a comprehensive analysis of how these multiple factors interact with each other and their combined effect, providing a deeper understanding of the dynamics at play.\n",
        "Example: Testing the effects of feed type (type A, B, or C) and barn crowding (not crowded, somewhat crowded, very crowded) on the final weight of chickens in a commercial farming operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "N-Way ANOVA (MANOVA): This is used when there are two or more dependent variables. The ANCOVA is used when the researcher includes one or more covariate variables in the analysis.\n",
